# O365-Outlook-OAuth2-Tools
Utilities for working with O365 Outlook and OAuth2

Many thanks to [Chilkat Software](https://www.chilkatsoft.com), their Perl library and examples saved me uncountable hours on this project.

To use o365-token-saver.pl:
1. Create an application in your AAD environment, and note the client ID and Client secret. (If you're not sure what this is, there is a [walkthrough](https://cknotes.com/create-azure-app-registration-for-use-with-imap-pop3-and-smtp/))
2. Install Perl (On Windows, use [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com))
3. Install the [Chilkat library](https://www.chilkatsoft.com/perl.asp)
4. Create a directory to work in, and download o365-token-saver.pl to it
5. Alter the code to include your Chilkat license key
6. Create a `.o365` directory under the work directory
7. Create the file `_nn_-config.json` in the `.o365` directory based on the `00-config.json` file in this repo
8. Replace all of the placeholders in that file with the appropirate values from your environment
9. IMPORTANT: If there is a firewall on the system where you are running this script, configure it to allow requests to TCP/3017 to reach `o365-token-saver.pl` or it won't work
10. Run `o365-token-saver.pl` with the `_nn_` from step 7 as the only command-line parameter
11. When the browser opens, enter the email address and password
12. If this is the first time using this account with this application, you will also need to grant the application the requested permissions
13. If you complete the sign-on within 30 seconds, the browser will display a success message
14. The access token has been saved as `_nn_-token.json` in the .o365 directory

The remaining instructions are application specific and won't make much sense without that application.

To use img-eng-email.pl.patch.o365:

On a system with a recent version of /usr/bin/img-eng-email.pl, use the command `patch -p0 < img-eng-email.pl.patch.o365` to alter it to invoke img-eng-email-o365.pl for message download when `cnf_Email_Import.cei_Options` contains the `365` flag.

To use img-eng-email-o365.pl:

1. Place it in the `/var/imaging/bin/` directory with appropriate ownereship and permission
2. Don't forget to update it to include your license key
3. Install the [Chilkat Perl library](https://www.chilkatsoft.com/perl.asp) that matches this version of Perl
4. Create the `/home/mailer/.o365` directory, with RWX permissions for the imaging group
5. Place the `_nn_-config.json` file used with `o365-token-saver.pl` in the directory created in step 2
6. Place the `_nn_-token.json` file generated by `o365-token-saver.pl` in the directory created in step 2
7. `psql images -c "UPDATE cnf_Email_Import SET cei_Options = cei_Options || ' 365' WHERE cei_Sequence = _nn_;"`
8. Optional: `su mailer` and run it manually with `/var/imaging/bin/img-eng-email-o365.pl _nn_`
9. Check `/var/log/imaging/mailer` to see if it is working
